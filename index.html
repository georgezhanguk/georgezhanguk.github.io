                    <h3>Analogue Music Synthesiser</h3>
                    <p>For my first year group project, I worked in a team of 3 to research, design and simulate an analogue music synthesisier. 
                    The synthesiser was designed to include key features of commercially available synthesisers. Our synthesiser therefore included:
                    - a Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) to produce square, triangular and sinusoidal waveforms between 27.5Hz to 4.186kHz 
                    - a Low Frequency Oscillator (LFO) to generate a tremolo or vibrato effect
                    - a Voltage Controlled Filter (VCF) and Voltage Controlled Amplifier (VCA) to emphasise or remove certain frequencies to produce distinctive sounds
                    - an ADSR envelope generator module to control the VCA and VCF
                    - an Output stage to drive a 8 Ohm loudspeaker.
                    This group project was awarded the Head of Department's Highly Commended Group Project and Best Analogue Music Synthesiser Prize. A short audio clip of our simulated synthesiser can be listened to below.

                    <h3>Mars Rover Project</h3>
                    <p>In this project, I worked and collaborated in a team of 7 to develop a Mars rover to autonomously explore an unknown environment. 
                    The rover autnonomously navigates and maps an alien city consisting of aliens of varying hues, buildings and underground bunkers.
                    The rover was divided into 7 subsystems: vision, control, command, radar, drive, energy and battery.
                    
                    I focused on the drive, energy and battery subsystems. 
                    Drive Subsystem - Using optical flow sensors to control and track the movement of the rover. Two optical flow sensors were used 
                    to improve the accuracy and fidelity of measurements. TO control rover motion, PID loops were implemented.
                    Energy and Battery Subsytems - Solar panels were used to charge the rover battery through a dual SMPS power electronics interface. 
                    A MPPT algoritm was used to maximise power transfer to the battery and a relay protection system to protect any over voltage scenarios.

                    This project was selected as the Heed of Department's Best Second Year Group Project.

                    <h3>Boost SMPS</h3>
                    <p>In this project, I designed a Boost Step-up SMPS converter in collaboration with Prateek Wagle for my Power Electronics coursework. 
                    The converter boosts an input voltage ranging from 3V to 4.2V to an ouptut voltage of 5V, 9V, 15V or 20V whilst fulfilling efficiency
                    and current ripple restrictions. 
                    
                    The converter was first designed, analysed and simulated in LT SPICE, before using Altium to desgin the board. Finally, a TI Tiva C 
                    series microprocessor was used to control the SMPS.</p>
